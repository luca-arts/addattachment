WebSocket Client in Unity (C#)
To get started with WebSocket client in Unity we will use Nuget the C# package manager to add a WebSocket C# library.

You can download the Nuget Unity plugin from [here](https://github.com/GlitchEnzo/NuGetForUnity/releases/latest/)

Once you imported the Nuget Unity package to your project, you can search for “WebSocketSharp-netstandard” and install to the Unity Project.
