# NPC player

NPC = Non Playable Character

There's always a player which you can see performing.
His/her performance has NO influence whatsoever on your performance.

He/she should always be scoring mediocre, so that we can be better than they can.

The NPC has the same setup as we do, it's a player, sitting in a chairlike object with a huge slingshot in front of him/her.
