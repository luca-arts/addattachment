# websocket
We'll open a websocket to a remote computer, to transfer all results.

Should we use OSC or another protocol to transmit messages on a certain bus?

## Unity side
Unity is client side
- we could capture the players name?
- 

## python side
Python is server side
We'll capture the messages and decode them.
- a name for the folder creation:
	- python script to create a default folder structure
- a start signal to start recording the EEG+GSR data
- per trial:
	- trial setup (contingency, what will be the response)
	- score at the end?
	- EOG data
	- trust in caregiver
	- something else? #TBD
