# shooting system

-   Necessary to be seated and not to move too muchÂ 
	-   EEG readings otherwise compromised
## overview

The player is seated in some sort of chair, in front of you there's a large slingshot.
When it's your turn to shoot, a ball appears next to you. You grab it and attach it to the slingshot. 
Once this is done, you can pull the slingshot and shoot it. The harder you pull, the harder the ball flies.

On the other side of the room, there are either pipes or trash nets which serve as [[targets]] for the balls. #TBD

## shooting
- assistance: difficulty level?
	- how will the NPC be assisted
	- how can the player be assisted?
- Have an assisting lineray showing were the ball would approx fly?

## scoring
Having the ball in the correct target gives 1 point.
Depending on how fast you can score, you get an extra point?
