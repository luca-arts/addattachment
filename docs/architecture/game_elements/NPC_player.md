# NPC player

NPC = Non Playable Character

There's always a player which you can see performing.
His/her performance has NO influence whatsoever on your performance.

He/she should always be scoring mediocre, so that we can be better than they can.

The NPC has the same setup as we do, it's a player, sitting in a chairlike object with a huge slingshot in front of him/her.

## assets

### game character

this should be a player from a list or can be just one player? #TBD 
If we want to play/compete against multiple players, we need more characters.

#### interaction with the slingshot
this animation should be recorded! 

## chair

we don't get to see our own chair, yet the other chair should be clearly visible.
