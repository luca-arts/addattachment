# Test trial
At the start of a block, a child gets explanation on how the game mechanics work.

One other player is in view, to show how to correctly play the ball.


The caregiver is allowed to give feedback already.

We'll indicate via the [[Data streams]] that for the first block, there's a test. Yet for the second block, we can go straight to the real evaluation? #TBD
