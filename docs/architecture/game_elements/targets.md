# targets
> Multiple options of targets which can have a differing feel, can be decided along the way.

## coloured pipes

- three coloured pipes, which either/combination
	- move a little bit, sometimes fast, sometimes slow ('snakes')
	- have sporadically an inward airflow, so the ball can sometimes be sucked in the wrong vent
	- the ball which we throw switches colour, make sure you send the ball in the right pipe. Yet the colour changes (bomb effect with glow "he's almost going to change color!")

## trash cans
![buckets](./imgs/blikvanger.jpg)

there are multiple trash cans positioned over the playfield. 
Above each trash can there's a spot aimed downwards, showing which trash can is the current target.
There's a random countdown for when to switch spots and thus to decide which is the correct goal.
