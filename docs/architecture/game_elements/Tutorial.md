# Tutorial

At the start of the first block, a child gets explanation on how the game mechanics work.

No other player is in view.
The child arrives at a white space.
Only the slingshot and a ball is shown, together with the moving rings.

No caregiver is in view

A voice guides the child, this is a **different** voice than the one of the caregiver!

We'll indicate via the [[Data streams]] that for the first block, there's a test. Yet for the second block, we can go straight to the real evaluation? #TBD
