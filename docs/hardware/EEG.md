# OpenBCI EEG Headset

## Physical Adaption

## Testing

In the OpenBCI GUI we check if we get a signal from all electrodes.

pylsl needs a specific library on the path, liblsl64.dll
To solve this, remove it if it was installed via conda. Install via pip again.


Inserting markers gives an error, why??
