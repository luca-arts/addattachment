## game design

in [game design folder](docs/architecture/readme.md) you can find the description of the game mechanics and actors.
**Tip** in order to view the content with correct links, I've used [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to create the docs. install it and open the folder contents in the app for correct linkage. It's an awesome notetaking tool in any case.
